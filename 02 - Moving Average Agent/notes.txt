The simple moving average is almost an extension of the Turtle Agent. Instead of calculating the moving average of the entire dataset, it calculates the window of the 
different regions in the dataset, `short_window` and `long_window`. 

Whenever a value in the `short_window` passes the `long_window`, that is how we know that we have a high value within the region. Otherwise, we have regular values or even
a buying value.
